            <p><b><span class="info">Overview</span>:</b></p>
            <p>Game designers create virtual worlds by bringing code to life and making it seem real. For many,</p>
            <p>the opportunity to design video games for a career is a dream job. Home to a diverse job market</p>
            <p>and growing industry, vidoe game design is more attractable now than ever before. However, playing</p>
            <p>video games is one thing, designing them is completely different. The more complex the game is the</p>
            <p>longer it will take to creating. Game design may not be a simple 9 to 5 job and could prove to be</p>
            <p>challenging. Even though the path of creating is not straight forward, the finished product makes</p>
            <p>all of the effort worth it.</p>

            <p>Most of the development will be in teams and each will have specific roles.</p>
