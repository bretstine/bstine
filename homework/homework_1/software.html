            <p>As technology progresses, the need for newer software becomes more prevalent. Hardware is no longer</p>
            <p>the thing that is holding technology back. Software is the limiting factor and must constantly be updated.</p>
            <p>Users do not necessarily interact with software directly, they interact with the applications that use</p>
            <p>software to run them. This type of technology is unique because it is intangible. Every computer has</p>
            <p>many different software applications on it and many industries rely on the software to work properly. Anything</p>
            <p>from medical equipment to airplanes use software to operate. Faulty software can have tangible effects</p>
            <p>and it is the job of software engineers to ensure that nothing will go wrong. These engineers will spend</p>
            <p>most of their time fixing or updating old code to keep the software up-to-date.</p>
